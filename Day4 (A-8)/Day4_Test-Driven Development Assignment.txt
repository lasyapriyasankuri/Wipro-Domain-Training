Test-Driven Development (TDD) Process

Definition: Test-Driven Development (TDD) is a software development approach where tests are written before the code. It involves writing tests to define desired functionality, then coding to pass those tests.
Icon/Visual: A cycle with "Test" leading to "Code" and then "Refactor."

TDD Process
1. Write a Test:
* Description: Start by writing a test that defines a new feature or functionality.
* Visual: A checklist or a test case with a red "X" indicating it will fail.
2. Run the Test:
* Description: Execute the test to ensure it fails, confirming that the functionality is not yet implemented.
* Visual: A test execution screen with a red cross.
3. Write Code:
* Description: Write just enough code to make the test pass.
* Visual: A developer writing code with a green check mark.
4. Run All Tests:
* Description: Run all tests to ensure the new code doesn't break existing functionality.
* Visual: A series of green checks indicating all tests passed.
5. Refactor Code:
* Description: Clean up the code to improve its structure without changing its behavior.
* Visual: A wrench or gear symbol representing code improvement.
6. Repeat:
* Description: Continue the cycle for each new feature or improvement.
* Visual: A looping arrow or cycle symbol.



Benefits of TDD
1. Bug Reduction:
* Description: Early detection of bugs due to frequent testing.
* Visual: A bug with a red "X" or a bug trap.
2. Improved Reliability:
* Description: Ensures each part of the code works correctly, leading to more reliable software.
* Visual: A shield or lock symbol indicating security and reliability.
3. Better Design:
* Description: Encourages writing modular and maintainable code.
* Visual: A clean, organized code structure or blueprint.
4. Documentation:
* Description: Tests serve as a form of documentation for the codebase.
* Visual: A document or a book with a checkmark.
