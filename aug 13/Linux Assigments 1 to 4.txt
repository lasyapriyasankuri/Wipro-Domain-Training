Assignment 1: Ensure the script checks if a specific file (e.g., myfile.txt) exists in the current directory. 
              If it exists, print "File exists", otherwise print "File not found".

Solution : 

file="myfile.txt"

if [ -f "$file" ]; then
  echo "File exists"
else
  echo "File not found"
fi


Assignment 2: Write a script that reads numbers from the user until they enter '0'. 
              The script should also print whether each number is odd or even.
Solution :

while true; do
  read -p "Enter a number (or 0 to quit): " num
  if [ "$num" -eq 0 ]; then
    break
  fi
  if [ $((num % 2)) -eq 0 ]; then
    echo "$num is even"
  else
    echo "$num is odd"
  fi
done

Assignment 3: Create a function that takes a filename as an argument and prints the number of lines in the file. 
              Call this function from your script with different filenames.

Solution :

#!/bin/bash

count_lines() {
  local file="$1"
  if [ -f "$file" ]; then
    echo "Number of lines in $file: $(wc -l < "$file")"
  else
    echo "File not found: $file"
  fi
}

count_lines "file1.txt"
count_lines "file2.txt"
count_lines "nonexistent_file.txt"

Assignment 4: Write a script that creates a directory named TestDir and inside it, creates ten files named File1.txt, File2.txt, ... File10.txt. 
	      Each file should contain its filename as its content (e.g., File1.txt contains "File1.txt").

Solution :

dir="TestDir"

if [ -d "$dir" ]; then
  echo "Directory $dir already exists"
else
  mkdir "$dir"
  for i in {1..10}; do
    file="File$i.txt"
    echo "$file" > "$dir/$file"
  done
  echo "Directory $dir created with 10 files"
fi
