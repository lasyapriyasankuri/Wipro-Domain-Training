Sprint Planning Ceremony : 

Purpose: The Sprint Planning ceremony is an essential part of the Scrum framework. It marks the beginning of a new sprint, where the team collaborates to define the work to be accomplished during the upcoming sprint. The primary goal is to set a realistic plan for delivering a potentially shippable product increment by the end of the sprint.

Participants:
Product Owner: Provides clarity on the product backlog items (PBIs) and their priorities.
Scrum Master: Facilitates the meeting, ensuring it stays focused and productive.
Development Team: Collaborates to estimate and commit to the work they can complete within the sprint.

Agenda:
Set the Sprint Goal:
The Product Owner presents the objective for the sprint, known as the sprint goal, which provides a clear focus and direction for the team.

Review the Product Backlog:
The Product Owner presents the prioritized product backlog items (PBIs) and provides detailed explanations.
The team discusses the PBIs, asking questions to clarify requirements and acceptance criteria.

Select PBIs for the Sprint:
The Development Team assesses the PBIs and determines which items they can realistically commit to completing within the sprint.
The selection is based on the team's velocity (the amount of work they have historically been able to complete in a sprint) and the complexity of the tasks.
Define the Sprint Backlog:
The Development Team breaks down the selected PBIs into smaller, manageable tasks.
Each task is estimated, usually in hours or story points, to ensure they fit within the sprint timeframe.

Task Assignment and Ownership:
Team members may voluntarily choose tasks based on their skills and interests.
The Scrum Master ensures that the workload is evenly distributed and that no team member is overburdened.
Plan for Potential Risks and Dependencies:
The team identifies any potential risks, dependencies, or obstacles that might impact the sprint.
Strategies for mitigating these risks are discussed and documented.
Finalize the Sprint Plan:
The Sprint Backlog, which includes the selected PBIs and their associated tasks, is finalized.
The team commits to the sprint goal and the work to be completed.

Duration:
Typically, the Sprint Planning meeting lasts around 2 hours for a 2-week sprint. For longer sprints, the meeting might take more time but should not exceed 8 hours.

Output:
Sprint Goal: A clear and concise objective for the sprint.
Sprint Backlog: A list of PBIs and their corresponding tasks that the team has committed to completing.
