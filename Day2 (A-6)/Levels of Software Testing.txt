>> Levels of Software Testing

Unit Testing:
Purpose: To validate that individual units or components of the software function as intended.
Performed by: Developers
Focus: Isolated code components or functions.

Integration Testing:
Purpose: To ensure that different units or modules work together as expected.
Performed by: Developers or Testers
Focus: Interactions between integrated units or modules.

System Testing:
Purpose: To validate the complete and integrated software product to ensure it meets the specified requirements.
Performed by: Testers
Focus: The entire system's functionality, performance, security, and overall behavior.

Acceptance Testing:
Purpose: To determine whether the software is ready for release and meets the end-users' requirements.
Performed by: End-users, clients, or stakeholders
Focus: User needs, business processes, and compliance with requirements.
Types: User Acceptance Testing (UAT), Alpha Testing, Beta Testing.

Regression Testing:
Purpose: To ensure that new code changes have not adversely affected existing functionalities.
Performed by: Testers
Focus: Previously tested functionalities after changes or enhancements.

Performance Testing:
Purpose: To assess the software's performance under various conditions, including load, stress, and scalability.
Performed by: Performance Testers
Focus: Response time, throughput, resource usage, and reliability under load.

Security Testing:
Purpose: To identify vulnerabilities and ensure that the software is protected against attacks.
Performed by: Security Testers
Focus: Data protection, authentication, authorization, and overall security measures.

Usability Testing:
Purpose: To evaluate the software's ease of use and user experience.
Performed by: Usability Testers or end-users
Focus: User interface, navigation, and overall user satisfaction.

Compatibility Testing:
Purpose: To ensure that the software works across different environments, such as browsers, devices, and operating systems.
Performed by: Testers
Focus: Software behavior across various configurations.
