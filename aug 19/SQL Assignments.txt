
Assignment 1: Design a database schema for a library system, including tables, fields, and constraints like NOT NULL, UNIQUE, and CHECK. 
	      Include primary and foreign keys to establish relationships between tables.

Assignment 2: Explain the ACID properties of a transaction in your own words. Write SQL statements to simulate a transaction that includes locking and 
	      demonstrate different isolation levels to show concurrency control.

Assignment 3: Write SQL statements to CREATE a new database and tables that reflect the library schema you designed earlier. Use ALTER statements to modify the 
	      table structures and DROP statements to remove a redundant table.

Ass Solution 1:

CREATE TABLE Authors (
  AuthorID INT PRIMARY KEY,
  Name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
  BirthDate DATE
);

CREATE TABLE Books (
  BookID INT PRIMARY KEY,
  Title VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
  ISBN VARCHAR(20) UNIQUE,
  Publisher VARCHAR(50),
  PublicationDate DATE
);

CREATE TABLE BookAuthors (
  BookID INT,
  AuthorID INT,
  PRIMARY KEY (BookID, AuthorID),
  FOREIGN KEY (BookID) REFERENCES Books(BookID),
  FOREIGN KEY (AuthorID) REFERENCES Authors(AuthorID)
);

CREATE TABLE Borrowers (
  BorrowerID INT PRIMARY KEY,
  Name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
  Email VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE,
  Phone VARCHAR(20)
);

CREATE TABLE Loans (
  LoanID INT PRIMARY KEY,
  BookID INT,
  BorrowerID INT,
  LoanDate DATE NOT NULL,
  DueDate DATE NOT NULL,
  ReturnDate DATE,
  FOREIGN KEY (BookID) REFERENCES Books(BookID),
  FOREIGN KEY (BorrowerID) REFERENCES Borrowers(BorrowerID)
); 
	
Ass Solution 2:

	-- Start transaction
BEGIN TRANSACTION;

-- Lock the Books table for exclusive access
LOCK TABLE Books IN EXCLUSIVE MODE;

-- Update the book title
UPDATE Books SET Title = 'New Title' WHERE BookID = 1;

-- Commit the transaction
COMMIT;

-- Demonstrate different isolation levels
-- Isolation Level: READ UNCOMMITTED
SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL READ UNCOMMITTED;
SELECT * FROM Books WHERE BookID = 1;

-- Isolation Level: READ COMMITTED
SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL READ COMMITTED;
SELECT * FROM Books WHERE BookID = 1;

-- Isolation Level: REPEATABLE READ
SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL REPEATABLE READ;
SELECT * FROM Books WHERE BookID = 1;

-- Isolation Level: SERIALIZABLE
SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL SERIALIZABLE;
SELECT * FROM Books WHERE BookID = 1;


Ass Solution 3:
